# Advanced JS Class

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timruffles/js-class.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timruffles/js-class)

It's a total priviledge to welcome you to the Advanced JS Class! Today we're going to look at getting the best from the JS of today and the near future: ES6 and beyond.

The class is exercise driven, so it's worth having a glance over the below to learn how to run the exercises.

## Structure

```sh
# here are the slides, in HTML format, yours to take home and enjoy! simply open slides/index.html in your favourite brower
./slides 

# whenever we're working on an exercise together, I'll point you to an exercise subfolder
./exercises

# app - it's more fun to learn by building something complete, so very often we'll be working on code in our `app` directory!
./app
```

## Exercises

Each exercise is a subfolder. You check your work by navigating to the folder in your terminal and running `npm run verify`.

Some exercises have an `exercise.js` file. Some have a `README.md` that specifies work we'll do in the `./app` directory. Finally some
have a `start-here.js` file where we right tests - this is for learning about TDD (test-driven development).
